# DoD-Document-Classification

This repository includes the notebooks used for training and evaluating each of the models in the paper "Creation and Analysis of a Natural Language Understanding Dataset for DoD Cybersecurity Policies (CSIAC-DoDIN V1.0)" for each task. There is a notebook per task. Future commits will centralize the code for all experiments, but for now is easy to reproduce using these notebooks.

Right now is assuming that it will be run on a Colab Notebook and the dataset will be accesible on a path on your drive. However the dataset will not be made availble publicly until review process finishes.
